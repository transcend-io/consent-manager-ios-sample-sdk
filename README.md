# Sample IOS Application

## Pods for sampleSDK
  ## Approach 1: For Transced Developers, If you are building sample applciation locally
    Note: Transcend customers cannot use this approach yet since we didn't pulish our cocoapod live
    - Step 1: Clone https://github.com/transcend-io/consent-manager-ios-library
    - Step 2: Build the library by clicking play button on Xcode or refer build command for ios-library's .github/workflows/build.yaml
    - Step 3: Uncomment the line below to use our library
      pod 'WebView', :path=> "../WebView/"


  ## Approach 2:
    ### For Transcend Developers
    We already have our framework build included in sampleSDK Frameworks(on XCODE check sampleSDK/Frameworks/Release-iphonesimulator)
    But if you are working on ios-library and want to change functionality in framework
      - Step 1: Build the library and find the build directory path
      - Step 2: delete the sampleSDK/Frameworks/Release-iphonesimulator and upload latest build
  
    ### For Transcend Customers:
      - Step 1: Download the Build.tar.gz or Build.zip
      - Step 2: Unizp and include the WebView.Framework and Pod_WebView.Framework on you applications Framework folder.
